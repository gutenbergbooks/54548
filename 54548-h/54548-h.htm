<h2>Poisonous Dwellers of the Desert</h2>
<p>The late Dr. Forrest Shreve of the Desert Laboratory in Tucson,
Arizona, stated that the principal characteristic of a desert is &ldquo;deficient
and uncertain rainfall.&rdquo; From our grammar school geographies we
gained the impression that a desert is a great expanse of sand piled into
dunes by the wind, without moisture or vegetation, a land of thirst, desolation,
even death.</p>
<p>Although sand dunes devoid of vegetation are characteristic of the
Sahara and some other deserts of the world, those of the United States
support a variety of plant and animal life which, through generations
of adaptation, are able to meet the conditions imposed by this environment
(see <a href="#fig1">frontispiece</a>). Persons who misunderstand our deserts fear
them, while others who have visited them become fascinated and return
periodically or settle down and live in them.</p>
<p>Some of the creatures living in deserts are known to be poisonous to
man. Western thriller fiction of press, screen, and TV has emphasized
and exaggerated this fact, developing in many people a wholly mistaken
fear of the desert and its inhabitants. In contrast, other persons may
under-estimate the possibility of injury from these animals and become
careless.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this booklet to discuss accurately the various poisonous
dwellers of the desert, as well as to debunk some of the superstitions
and misunderstandings which have developed.</p>
<p>A majority of the poisonous creatures in the desert are by no means
restricted to that environment. Rattlesnakes, for example, so often associated
with the arid regions of the West, occur in nearly every section
of the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poison,&rdquo; states <i>Encyclopedia Brittanica</i>, &ldquo;is a substance which,
by its direct action on the mucous membrane, tissues, or skin, or after
absorption into the circulatory system can, in the way which it is administered,
injuriously affect health or destroy life.&rdquo; A poisonous
creature may be defined as one which produces a poison for the administering
of which it has developed a special mechanism.</p>
<p>Since, due to personal differences, the bite or sting of a poisonous
creature may injuriously affect the health of one person and not that of
another, and since the poison of one individual creature may be insufficient
to cause an unpleasant reaction, while that from several hundred
might produce severe illness or even death, it is difficult to determine
which creature should be included in a publication of this nature. The
writer, therefore, has exercised his judgment in discussing in the following
pages such creatures as he feels may offer a menace to the welfare
of a visitor to the desert. In addition, a few paragraphs are included for
the defense of several harmless desert dwellers which are mistakenly
believed poisonous and which, as a result, have been mercilessly persecuted.</p>

<p>It should be understood that the author has not himself conducted
scientific research among the desert animals regarding which he writes.
The material in this book is a digest of the findings of various competent
scientific and medical authorities, and has been carefully checked
for accuracy and authenticity.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be frightened as a result of reading this booklet. The desert
is just as safe&mdash;perhaps safer&mdash;for homemaking as many other parts
of our country.</p>
<h2 id="c4">Giant desert centipede
<br /><span class="smaller">(<i>Scolopendra heros</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Many species of centipedes of various sizes and colors are found
throughout the world. The majority are small, harmless, and not sufficiently
numerous to be considered seriously, even as pests.</p>
<p>Usually they are found under boards, in cracks and crevices, in basements
and closets, and in other moist locations where they hide during
the day and venture forth at night in search of small insects for food.</p>
<p>The large, poisonous desert centipede attains a length of 6 or even
8 inches and has jaws of sufficient strength to inflict a painful bite.
Glands at the base of the jaw produce poison which causes the area
about the bite to swell and become feverish and painful. Persons who
have been bitten report that the swelling and tenderness may persist for
several weeks, that the bite sometimes suppurates and is difficult and
slow to heal.</p>
<p><i>Because the bite of even a large centipede is usually a painful inconvenience
rather than a serious injury, no specific treatment has been
developed. Application of an antiseptic such as iodine immediately following
receipt of the bite, working it well into the fang punctures, is
advised. Bathing the site of the bite with strong ammonia will bring relief
if done immediately, while soaking the area in a solution of hot Epsom
salts may shorten the period of discomfort. Prompt treatment by
a physician will reduce duration and intensity of pain.</i></p>
<p>Although the bite of a large centipede is no joke, it is not cause for
fear or worry. Exaggerated stories of the deadly effects of the bite, and
reports that the tip of each leg carries a poisonous spur, have caused
many persons to be overly afraid of centipedes. Hysteria and shock resulting
from this unfounded fear probably have been the cause of more
suffering than the bites themselves.</p>
<p>The tip of each of the 42 legs of the giant desert centipede is equipped
with a sharp claw. It is possible when the centipede scurries across
a person&rsquo;s arm or leg for these claws to make pin-point punctures. Infection
introduced through these tiny openings readily leads to the
belief that poison has been injected. Prompt application of an antiseptic
will greatly reduce the possibility of infection.</p>

<h2 id="c5">Scorpions</h2>
<p>More deaths have occurred in Arizona from scorpion sting than from
the bites and stings of all other creatures combined. It is apparent that
scorpions are dangerous, that all persons should be informed regarding
them, and that details of first-aid treatment should be common knowledge.</p>
<p>In some parts of the South, scorpions are called &ldquo;stinging lizards.&rdquo;
This is unfortunate because it has caused many people to think of lizards
as poisonous and capable of stinging.</p>
<p>Not all scorpions are deadly. Danger from the two deadly species
(one shown above) which look so much alike that only an expert can
tell them apart, is greatest to children under 4 years of age. Unless
prompt action is taken small children might succumb to the poison from
a single sting from an individual of either of the deadly species. Older
children may die from the effect of several stings, and adults, especially
those in poor health, may suffer serious injuries.</p>
<p>Of the more than 20 species of scorpions recorded in Arizona where
detailed studies have been made, the two deadly forms have been found
only across the southern portion of the State and in the bottom of
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Grand Canyon. As far as is now known, no other deadly species occur
in the Southwest, except in Mexico where there are several.</p>
<p>It is important, then, that all persons should recognize the deadly
species. Study the photograph. Note that the deadly species (left) is
about 2 inches in length, is straw colored, and that its entire body, especially
the joints of the legs, pincers, and &ldquo;tail,&rdquo; are long and slender.
It has a streamlined appearance. This is in contrast with the stubby or
chunky appearance of the many non-deadly species.</p>
<p>Scorpions sting, they do not bite. The pincers at the head end of
the body are for the purpose of holding the prey, which consists primarily
of soft-bodied insects, while the scorpion tears it to pieces with its
jaws.</p>
<p>The sting is located at the extremity of the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; and consists of a
very sharp, curved tip attached to a bulbous organ containing the poison-secreting
glands and poison reservoir. The sting is driven into the
flesh of the victim by means of a quick, spring-like flick of the &ldquo;tail.&rdquo;
Muscular pressure forces the poison into the wound through two tiny
openings very near the sting tip. Thus the poison is injected beneath
the skin, making treatment difficult, as the impervious skin renders surface
application ineffective.</p>
<p>Whereas the poison of non-deadly species of scorpions is local in
effect, causing swelling and discoloration of the tissues in immediate
proximity to the point of puncture, that of the deadly species is general
over the entire body of the victim. There is intense pain at the site of
the sting but very little inflammation or swelling.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="500" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Giant desert hairy scorpion in alert position.</i></p>
</div>
<p>According to Kent and Stahnke<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>, &ldquo;the victim soon becomes restless.
This increases to a degree that, in cases of small children, the patient
is entirely unable to cooperate with attendants. It turns, frets, and does
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
not remain quiet for an instant. The abdominal muscles may become
rigid, and there may be contractions of the arms and legs. Drooling of
saliva begins, and the heart rate increases. The temperature may reach
103 or 104 degrees. Cyanosis (skin turning blue) gradually appears,
and respiration becomes increasingly difficult, causing a reaction not
unlike that observed in a severe case of bronchial asthma. Involuntary
urination and defecation may occur. In fatal cases the above symptoms
may become so marked that apparently the child dies from exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In cases that recover, the acute symptoms subside in 12 hours or
less. In the adult, symptoms as enumerated may be encountered, but as
a rule they are less severe. Numbness is usually experienced at the
site of the sting. If one of the appendages is stung, the member may
become temporarily useless. Two cases of temporary blindness have
been experienced. Some patients complain of malaise (discomfort) for
many days following the sting. One patient developed a tachycardia
(rapid heart) lasting two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c6">Treatment of scorpion stings</h3>
<p>Dr. Stahnke recommends the following treatment for a person stung
by one of the deadly scorpions:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;First, apply a tight tourniquet near the point of puncture and between
it and the heart.... As soon as possible, place an ice pack on the
site of the sting. Have a pack of finely crushed ice wrapped in as thin
a cloth as possible. Cover and surround the area for about 10 to 12
inches. After the ice pack has been in place for approximately 5 minutes,
remove the tourniquet.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;If a person is stung on the hand, foot, or other region that can be
submerged completely, place the portion, as soon as possible, in an ice-and-water
mixture made of small lumps of ice (about half the size of
ice cubes) in a proportion of half ice and half water. Treatment should
not be continued longer than 2 hours.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;NEVER put salt in the water. After the first 15 minutes, the hand
or foot must be removed for relief for 1 minute every 10 minutes in the
iced water.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Dr. Stahnke continues: &ldquo;If the patient is less than 3 years old, if the
patient has been stung several times, or if the patient has been stung
on the back of the neck, anywhere along the backbone, or on an area
of deep flesh like the buttock, thigh, or trunk of the body, or especially
on the genital organs, medical assistance should be obtained at once.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Dr. F. A. Shannon advises that no person with disease involving the
circulation of the extremities should use iced water. Morphine is a necessary
tool in controlling pain, and barbiturates are useful for control
of convulsions.</i></p>
<p>Several hospitals in southern Arizona keep a supply of scorpion antivenin
and, in any case, the patient should be taken to a hospital as
quickly as possible. In all cases the first-aid treatment should be applied
and maintained until the patient is under the care of a physician.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>With adults, in case a physician is not available, the iced-water treatment
usually proves sufficient. Generally, after 2 hours of iced-water
use, there is no longer any danger, but should symptoms reappear,
treatment should be resumed.</p>
<p>Scorpion antivenin for stings of <i>Centruroides sculpturatus</i> and <i>C.
gertschi</i> is available at the Poisonous Animals Research Laboratory,
Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona. The recommended method
of treatment is the &ldquo;L-C&rdquo; method. The L stands for ligature and C for
cryotherapy (tourniquet and ice pack treatment).</p>
<p><i>Treatment is as follows: &ldquo;As soon as possible (after the sting has
been received) inject intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 5 to 10 cc. of
natural serum or 3 cc. of the concentrated. In serious cases, inject intravenously.&rdquo;
No immediate untoward results have been noted, but some
cases of skin irritation develop later.</i></p>
<p>In cases of scorpion poisoning when antivenin is not available, the
following treatment is recommended<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Use morphine with extreme caution. It has not been found effective
in the usual doses. Barbiturates are more effective and less dangerous.
Bromides in large doses are apparently of value. In those cases characterized
by severe pulmonary edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs)
atropine is indicated along with general supportive measures. Compresses,
using a fairly concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution,
have been found helpful if applied within a few moments. If applied
for the first time about 10 minutes after the sting, no apparent benefit
is attained.&rdquo;</i></p>
<h3 id="c7">Where scorpions live</h3>
<p>Scorpions normally remain in hiding during the day, coming out in
search of insects at night. The deadly species are commonly found under
bark on old stumps, in lumber piles, or in firewood piled in dark
corners. It is not unusual to find them in basements or in linen closets.
Adults may find an unpleasant surprise in a shoe or a piece of clothing
taken from a closet or dresser drawer. Legs of cribs or children&rsquo;s beds
may be placed in cans containing kerosene or in wide-mouthed jars.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Moral</span>: Keep your garage, basement, and premises in general, clean,
tidy, and free from insects on which scorpions feed. Screen children&rsquo;s
cribs, and pull the sheets clear back before putting the youngsters to
bed. Shake out your shoes before putting them on, and inspect sheets,
blankets, or clothing which have been in closets or drawers.</p>
<h2 id="c8">Black widow spider
<br /><span class="smaller">(<i>Lactrodectus mactans</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Although spiders in general produce venom with which to paralyze
their prey, only a very few have fangs of sufficient length or power to
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
penetrate human skin, or venom of sufficient quantity or potency to affect
human health.</p>
<p>There are two poisons present in spider venom: a toxin which cause
local symptoms, and a toxalbumin producing general symptoms. In
those spiders whose bites produce systematic disturbances it is believed
that the latter poison predominates.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Where black widows live</h3>
<p>Black widows spin their webs in crevices between rocks, under logs
or overhanging banks, in abandoned rodent holes, and in rock and
wood piles. Indoors they are most frequently encountered in dark
corners of garages, basements, and stables.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="378" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Underside of black widow spider showing characteristic red &ldquo;hourglass&rdquo; mark on the
abdomen by which this species may be recognized.</i></p>
</div>
<p>A favorite and especially dangerous location in which a black widow
establishes her home is beneath the seat of a pit toilet. Such a location
is ideal for the spider because it is dark, is not usually disturbed, and
insects, especially flies, upon which the spiders feed, are abundant. Humans
using the toilet, unaware of the presence of the spider, arouse her
by breaking or agitating her web, and offer especially tender and susceptible
portions of their anatomies for her bite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Pit toilets in warm climates should always be built with hinged seats
which should be raised and inspected frequently. As a further precaution,
the underside of the seats should be treated with creosote, an effective
repellent.</p>
<p>Although the majority of people now recognize the black widow,
some do not, hence they kill all dark-colored spiders on general principles.
This is neither necessary nor desirable.</p>
<p>The female black widow is a medium-sized, glossy black, solitary
spider with a globular abdomen spectacularly marked on the underside
with a bright red spot roughly the shape of an hourglass. The normal
position of the spider is hanging upside down in her web so that the
&ldquo;hourglass&rdquo; is plainly visible if she is below the level of the eye. Her
overall length is 1 to 1&frac14; inches.</p>
<p>The males are much smaller and, like the immature females, are grey
in color and variously striped and spotted.</p>
<p>Adult females spin egg cocoons during the warm season; each cocoon
contains approximately 300 to 500 eggs which hatch in about 30 days.
As many as nine broods per year have been recorded. The young grow
fast but do not mature until the following spring or summer.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Black widow bites</h3>
<p>Although black widows ferociously pounce upon insects or other
spiders much larger than themselves which become entangled in their
webs, they are by nature retiring and bite humans only when restrained
from escape by contact with the body of man.</p>
<p>The fangs, which are about one-fiftieth of an inch in length, serve
to inject from two large glands the venom which is reported to be much
more virulent per unit than that of the rattlesnake.</p>
<p>There is some pain and swelling at the site of the bite. The pain
spreads throughout the body, centering at the extremities, which become
cramped, and over the abdomen, where the muscles become rigid.
There is nausea and vomiting, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, ringing
in the ears, and headache. Blood pressure is raised, eye pupils are
dilated and the reflexes are overactive. Medical records, according to
Bogen<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>, show that &ldquo;despite its severe symptoms, arachnidism (poisoning
by spider, tick, or scorpion) is, in the majority of cases, a self-limiting
condition, and generally clears up spontaneously within a few
days,&rdquo; although cases of death resulting from black widow bites are
on record<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Treatment of black widow bites</h3>
<p><i>Since the venom of the black widow, among other properties, appears
to affect the nervous system, its effect is almost instantaneous,
and most first-aid measures are of little value.</i></p>
<p><i>Stahnke has found that the iced-water treatment (as described in
detail in the <a href="#c6">scorpion section</a> of this booklet) is beneficial. The points
of puncture should be treated with iodine, the patient kept as quiet as
possible, and an ice pack applied or the part submerged in iced-water,
and a physician summoned immediately.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p><i>Baerg<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> recommends hot baths&mdash;as hot as the patient can endure.
These should be used only in cases of advanced poisoning, never immediately
after the bite is received.</i></p>
<p><i>Internal use of alcohol is dangerous, and a person bitten when intoxicated
would have much less chance of recovery.</i></p>
<p>Professional treatment consists mostly in the use of opiates, hydrotherapy,
and similar measures to alleviate the acute pain. Of more than
75 different remedies used, three seem to be outstanding as palliatives:
spinal puncture, intravenous injections of Epsom salts, and intramuscular
administration of convalescent serum when given within 8 hours.
Dr. Charles Barton, of Los Angeles, recommends intramuscular or intravenous
injection of calcium gluconate, 10 cc. in a 10 per cent solution.
The patient should be encouraged to drink as much water as he
will. He usually leaves the hospital on the fourth day. Recent experiments
with an injection of neostigmine followed by one of atropine
have had encouraging results, and the use of ACTH in several cases
has had spectacular results, according to <i>Readers&rsquo; Digest</i> (Nov. 1951,
p. 45).</p>
<h3 id="c12">Control of black widows</h3>
<p>Because of their wide distribution and secretive habits, black widows
are difficult to control. Basements, outbuildings, and garages should be
cleaned frequently, and black widow webs and eggs destroyed. If accessible,
the spider may be dislodged from her web with a broom, and
smashed. The use of a blowtorch, where there is no fire hazard, is effective
for both spiders and egg cocoons. Insect sprays, in general, are
ineffectual.</p>
<h2 id="c13">Brown recluse spider
<br /><span class="smaller">and its venomous relatives</span></h2>
<p>Until recently the black widow was considered the only spider in the
United States dangerous to man. In 1955, physicians in Missouri and
Arkansas began treating persons suffering from the bite of the brown
recluse spider, whose poison caused serious damage to the skin at the
site of the puncture and often produced a severe systemic reaction
sometimes fatal to young children.</p>
<p>The spider is approximately &#8309;/&#8321;&#8326; inch in length, dark brown to fawn,
with long legs. A violin-shaped spot on the upper side of the cephalothorax
(head portion) is the only noticeable identification giving rise
to another common name&mdash;fiddleback spider. It is also known as
brown spider, or brown house spider.</p>
<p>Little has been published on its life history, but it has been reported
from Kansas, Illinois, the Gulf Coast, and from Tennessee to Oklahoma.
It is extending its territory westward and has recently been reported
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
from southeastern New Mexico and southern California. People
are contributing to the rapid geographical spread of this species by
unknowingly carrying it across state lines in their luggage. The brown
recluse spider, according to Paul N. Morgan, research microbiologist at
the Little Rock, Arkansas, Veterans Administration Hospital, &ldquo;constitutes
a hazard to the health of man, perhaps greater than the Black
Widow.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c14">Where found</h3>
<p>It is found in open fields and rocky bluffs but thrives particularly
well in outhouses, garages, dark closets, storerooms, and in piles of
sacking or old clothing. Its web is large and irregular.</p>
<h3 id="c15">The brown recluse bite</h3>
<p>Because of the spider&rsquo;s nocturnal and retiring habits few people are
bitten, in spite of a large spider population. According to an article in
the August, 1963 Journal of the Arkansas Medical Society, &ldquo;there may
be mild transitory stinging at the time of the bite, but there is little
associated early pain. The patient may be completely unaware he has
been bitten, and the spider is seldom seen. Only after 2 to 8 hours does
pain, varying from mild to severe, begin. After several days an ulcer
may form at the site of the bite. The venom appears to contain a
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
spreading factor resulting in a spread of the necrosis or tissue destruction.
In some instances, the ulcer may be so large that skin grafting is
required, but the graft may take poorly or not at all. &ldquo;The bite may
also produce serious systemic symptoms including fever, chills, weakness,
vomiting, joint pain, and a spotty skin eruption, all occurring
within 24-48 hours after the venom injection.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c16">Treatment for bite of the brown recluse spider</h3>
<p>Physicians at the University of Arkansas Medical Center, Little
Rock, prefer the prompt administration of corticosteroids, stating,
&ldquo;Large doses given early may completely prevent the gangrenous response
as well as the systemic reaction. The dosage schedule which we
have found most effective is: 80 mg. of methylprednisolone (Deep-Medrol)
intramuscularly immediately followed by one or two additional
doses of same amount at 24-48 hour intervals. Subsequently, step
wise decrease to 40, 20, 10 mg., every 24-48 hours, depending on the
patient&rsquo;s response, is carried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Herbert L Stahnke, Director of the Arizona Poisonous Animals
Research Laboratory, reports that an antivenin has been prepared in
South America to control both the local and general symptoms from
the bite of a closely related species of <i>Loxosceles</i>. He states, &ldquo;locally
there seems to be a favorable response to hydroxyzine, 100 mg. four
times a day. I would say that cryotherapy, as we recommend it, would
prevent all symptoms. I would recommend that the site of the bite be
packed in crushed ice for 6 to 8 hours, after which the patient should
be kept warm to the point of perspiration with the ice pack continuing
for a total of 24 hours. In other words, treated like a pit viper bite, but
over a much shorter period of time.&rdquo; Avoid narcotics (morphine, demerol,
dilaudid, codeine, etc.) since they enhance the systemic effects.</p>
<p>Although the brown recluse has not yet been reported in Arizona,
it may be expected at any time, according to Dr. Mont A. Cazier, professor
of zoology at Arizona State University at Tempe. In the meantime,
studies are being made of the several close relatives of <i>Loxosceles
reclusa</i> known to be present in the state. Among these is <i>L. unicolor</i>,
first collected near Littlefield and Virgin Narrows in 1932. Equally
poisonous with <i>reclusa</i> is the similar <i>L. laeta</i>, also found in Arizona.
Other members of the genus, <i>L. deserta</i> and <i>L. arizonica</i>, have been
known to live in Arizona and elsewhere in the Southwest for more than
three decades, but no studies have been made of their venom. Dr. Willis
J. Gertsch, world famous authority on spiders, believes that there
may be as many as 20 species of <i>Loxosceles</i> in the Southwest. Several
reports by persons who have been bitten by spiders describe reactions
similar to those caused by the bite of the brown recluse.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Findley E. Russell, toxicology researcher of the
University of Southern California Medical School, the &ldquo;venom&rdquo; injected
by the brown spider is not really a toxin but a complete chemical
that inhibits the normal action of infection-fighting antibodies
in the human anatomy.</p>

<h2 id="c17">Tarantulas
<br /><span class="smaller">(<i>Avicularia</i> sp.)</span></h2>
<p>Known to naturalists as bird spiders, the large hairy members of the
genera <i>Avicularia</i>, <i>Dugesiella</i>, and <i>Aphonopelma</i> of the arid Southwest
are commonly called tarantulas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">

<p class="pcap"><i>Tarantula</i>
<span class="attr ss smaller">(Photo by Marvin H. Frost Sr.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>This name originated in southern Italy where, centuries ago, according
to a story, in the little town of Tarantum (now Taranto) there
developed an epidemic of &ldquo;tarentism&rdquo; supposedly resulting from the
bite of a large wolf spider (<i>Lycosa tarantula</i>). Victims were affected
with melancholy, stupor, and an irresistible desire to dance. Presumably,
the Neapolitan folk dance, Tarentella, came about as a result of
an effort to develop a cure for tarentism.</p>
<p>Early day immigrants brought to the western hemisphere both the
unreasoning fear of spider bites and the name &ldquo;tarantula,&rdquo; which they
applied to the large and fearsome-looking bird spider of the Southwest.
Since that time this superstitious fear has become established among the
uneducated and uninformed people of the southwestern United States,
where the bird spiders are numerous.</p>
<p>It has been spread and aggravated by prolific writers of western
thrillers, published in the pulp-paper magazines. Fantastic tales in
which the big spiders followed their victims, sprang upon them from
distances of from 6 to 10 feet, and inflicted painful bites resulting in
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
lingering, agonizing death have had wide circulation and have found
a credulous audience.</p>
<p>Tarantulas are nearsighted, and their habit of pouncing upon grasshoppers
and other large insects on which they prey is probably the
basis for exaggerated stories of their jumping abilities. Their strong,
sharp fangs can inflict a painful bite, but they use them only rarely in
defense against human molestation. Stahnke states that any effects
produced appear to be the result of bacterial infection rather than that
of poison, although a mild poison is present. Treatment of tarantula
bite with iodine or similar antiseptic is recommended.</p>
<p>One species of <i>Avicularia</i> and several of <i>Aphonopelma</i> range
throughout the Southwest where they are active during spring, summer,
and autumn months. They live in web-lined holes in the ground, usually
located on south-facing slopes. The males are commonly encountered
traveling across country, and are particularly noticeable as they
cross a highway.</p>
<p>Preying upon insects, these large and interesting desert dwellers
are beneficial rather than harmful to mankind, and deserve protection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many become the innocent victims of the wholly unwarranted
fear in which they are held because of the fantastic stories
regarding their purported poisonous characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="c18">Conenose bug
<br /><span class="smaller">(Kissing bug, Bellows bug, Walpai tiger, Cross bug, others)<br />(<i>Triatoma</i> sp.)</span></h2>
<p>Although not limited to the deserts of the Southwest, conenose bugs,
of which there are several species, are commonly associated with subtropical
climates.</p>
<p>Certain South American species of the family <i>Reduviidae</i> are disease
carrying and there is evidence the conenoses in San Diego County,
California, are infected with a disease-producing flagellate. Lack of
large bug populations in close contact with man and ineffective transmission
habits protect man in the Southwest from disease contacts.
However, the site of the bug&rsquo;s bite becomes inflamed, and swelling may
spread over an area up to a foot in diameter.</p>
<p>In general appearance, conenose bugs resemble assassin and squash
bugs, with protruding eyes at the base of a cone-shaped snout and are
about the same size. Some species are considerably smaller, while others
attain a length of an inch or more.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Habitat of conenose bugs</h3>
<p>Since conenose bugs subsist upon animal blood which they suck from
the capillaries by inserting the stylets of the proboscis, they seek locations
where there is a source of blood. These include livestock barns,
poultry houses, and human habitations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>

<br /><i>Adult male (rounded abdomen); Adult female (pointed abdomen)</i>
<span class="attr ss smaller">(Photo courtesy of Dr. Sherwin F. Wood)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Studies conducted by Wehrle<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> show that conenoses are parasitic on
woodrats and breed in the dens of these rodents. They are also found
in meadow vole (mouse) nests. Early in May the winged conenose adults
begin dispersal flights, invading human habitations in the vicinity
of woodrat dens. Although reported as most active in May and
June, they may be expected throughout the summer until October, and
are much more numerous in the country than in cities.</p>
<p>During the daytime, the insects remain hidden under rugs, between
quilts, or even in bedding or behind drapes. They may be seen during
the evening on ceiling beams, walls, curtains, and around windows.
They are alert and difficult to catch.</p>
<p>Conenose bugs do not attack people until the victim is quiet or asleep,
and may take blood without awakening the host. Immediately
after being bitten, however, the victim is awakened by severe itching.
The area about the puncture swells and becomes red and feverish.
Welts at the point of puncture are hard, and may be 1 to 3 inches in
diameter.</p>
<p>About 5% of the people repeatedly bitten develop severe allergic
reactions with burning pain and itching at the site of the bite, itching
on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, neck, and groin; general
body swelling, and a nettle-like rash over the body. Some persons feel
ill, with light depression followed by quickening of the pulse. Others
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
are faint, weak, and nauseated. In very severe allergy these symptoms
may lead to anaphylactic shock and unconsciousness.</p>
<h3 id="c20">Treatment of conenose bites</h3>
<p>Although a specific treatment for conenose bites has not been developed,
some physicians use epinephrine. More promising results appear
possible with antihistamine preparations (under doctor&rsquo;s prescription)
such as benadryl and pyribenzamine, which have been effective by
mouth, and in severe reactions, by intravenous injections.</p>
<p>Matheson<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> writes: &ldquo;When a blood-sucking insect bites, it is always
possible that the proboscis may be contaminated with pathogenic organisms.
If such organisms become localized near the point of puncture or
gain access to the blood stream, results may be serious. It is always
wise to use some disinfectant such as alcohol, tincture of iodine, etc.,
and to press out the blood, if possible, from bites made by insects.&rdquo; Antibiotics
are frequently necessary to control the extremely high percentage
of secondary infections.</p>
<p>Physicians recommend the application of a hot Epsom salt pack over
the point of puncture as soon as possible after the bite has been received.
Application of antiphlogistine alleviates the severe itching. ACTH
is recommended by some physicians. Hydrocortizone ointments reduce
the skin eruptions and local pain.</p>
<h3 id="c21">Control of conenose bugs</h3>
<p>Prevention is more satisfactory than treatment, and since conenoses
live in woodrat dens, these rodents should be eliminated from the vicinity.
Weatherstripping around all permanent doors and screen doors,
tight-fitting, holeless screens in all windows, and fine screens in fireplace
chimneys will help to keep the bugs out of houses. Occasionally
they may be seen on walls and ceilings in the evening, and may be killed
with a flyswatter.</p>
<p>If impossible to keep the insects out of the house, sleeping persons
may be protected by the use of mosquito netting. It is especially important
that the beds of babies and young children should be safe-guarded
because of the danger from scorpions.</p>

<p>Bedding should be shaken thoroughly just before children retire, because

themselves in bedding during the daytime.</p>
<h2 id="c22">Ants, wasps, hornets, bees</h2>
<p>Stinging insects all belong to the group <i>Hymenoptera</i> and consist of
the families <i>Apidae</i> (honeybee, etc.), <i>Bombidae</i> (bumblebee), <i>Vespidae</i>
(wasps and hornets), <i>Sphecidae</i> (thread-waisted wasps), <i>Mutillidae</i>
(velvet ants), and <i>Formicidae</i> (the ants).</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Wasp</i></p>
</div>
<p><i>In general, the only treatment recommended for insect stings is to
bathe the parts with ordinary liquid household bluing just as soon as
possible after the sting has been received, and apply hot compresses.
However, certain specific treatments are advised, depending upon the
particular species or condition.</i></p>
<p>Some persons are extremely susceptible to insect bites and stings,
and preliminary work has been done in trying to immunize those sensitive
individuals, but, in general, with very little success. The problem
of immunizing or desensitizing persons who are allergic to insect bites
and stings is one of considerable importance, as such unfortunate persons
will testify.</p>
<p>Because of the fact that honeybees are of such great economic importance,
not only as producers of an important food but also as pollenizers
of fruit, vegetable, seed, and other crops, they will be discussed
separately from the other stinging insects.</p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with ants, wasps, hornets, and bumblebees, and
there are very few persons who have not had unpleasant experiences
with one or more of these groups of insects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h3 id="c23"><i>Ants and velvet ants</i></h3>
<p>Velvet ants, which are in reality wingless wasps and not true ants,
are not as well known as the others, although the little creatures that
scurry about like brightly dyed bits of cotton are quite numerous in
the desert.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the sting is to paralyze or kill their prey, although
it becomes more important as a weapon of defense with insects
which do not prey upon or parasitize other creatures. Although the solitary
insects use their poison as a means of personal defense if attacked
or imposed upon, the social insects such as ants, social wasps and hornets,
honeybees, and others, rally to the defense of their nests and in
mass attacks against an intruder may cause painful and sometimes serious
injury.</p>
<p>Although the small amount of poison introduced beneath the skin by
the sting of one of these creatures usually causes only temporary discomfort,
there are sometimes after effects which may be more intense
and of longer duration with some persons than with others. In general,
stinging insects may be considered more as a nuisance than a menace,
although a person attacked by a large number, or subjected to their
stings for some length of time, might receive serious and perhaps fatal
injuries. Known deaths have been caused by the sting of imported fire
ants in southeastern States. The species is believed to be spreading.
Treatment by a physician may include the use of ACTH and calmitol.</p>
<p>Although ants and velvet ants are commonly considered as wingless,
they are, actually, winged. Male velvet ants have wings whereas the
females are normally without wings. The females have a very effective
sting, and if picked up or pinched they make every effort to use it, at
the same time emitting a peculiar faint squeaking sound.</p>
<p>True ants, of which there are hundreds of species, are social insects
living in colonies containing the mother, or queen, which becomes wingless
after fertilization; numerous workers, or non-fertile females; and
young winged males and females.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h3 id="c24"><i>Control of ants</i></h3>
<p>Ants of various species are numerous on the desert, some of them becoming
serious household pests, difficult to control.</p>
<p>There are effective ant poisons on the market, but the surest method
of control is to find the nest and destroy it. Ants that are household
pests usually are either grease eaters or sweet eaters, and the proper
poison for the specific type should be obtained in attempting to rid
the house of these insects.</p>
<h3 id="c25"><i>Wasps, hornets, yellowjackets, bees</i></h3>
<p>Wasps, hornets, yellowjackets, and bees of many species are common
in the desert, some species being solitary in habit while others live
in colonies or nests which they defend with great pugnacity.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="488" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Bumblebee</i></p>
</div>
<p>Although humans have little to fear from these insects if they leave
them strictly alone, some species select nest sites beneath overhanging
eaves or in attics or lofts, thus becoming persistent pests. They are
usually tolerated until one or more members of the family are stung.</p>
<p>Other species are attracted to human habitations by the presence
of sweets or other edibles, and make persistent nuisances of themselves.
They are capable of inflicting painful injuries, and are greatly feared
by many persons.</p>
<p><i>Not usually serious, these injuries do not respond to any treatment
that has yet been developed. Immediate application of strong ammonium
hydroxide (household ammonia) is a home treatment which has</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
<i>been found helpful for ant stings, and, in most cases, for the stings of
other insects.</i></p>
<p><i>A piece of ice held at the point of puncture will relieve the pain and
burning sensation in the majority of cases of insect sting.</i></p>
<p><i>In serious cases, of course, the services of a physician should be obtained
immediately.</i></p>
<h2 id="c26">Honeybee
<br /><span class="smaller">(<i>Apis mellifera</i>)</span></h2>
<p>At first thought it may seem unjustified to include the common honeybee
in a discussion of poisonous creatures of the desert. Although
the honeybee is not a desert native, having been imported from Europe,
it has established itself in the wild state throughout the Southwest
in locations providing adequate moisture and sufficient nectar-producing
flowers.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="500" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Honeybees on the honeycomb</i></p>
</div>
<p>Throughout much of the United States honeybees are encountered
in numbers only in apiaries operated by beekeepers, or in bee trees
where the insects have established themselves. In the desert climatic
conditions are ideal for honeybees, and they have become widespread
and well established.</p>
<p>They obtain water at springs, seeps, waterholes, cattle tanks, dripping
faucets, and leaking water containers, often congregating in such
numbers around sources of water that they become a distinct nuisance
to men and to animals. Individual honeybees are frequently found in
flowers, or may fly in through an open automobile window, and sting
one of the car&rsquo;s occupants. Small children sometimes receive stings
while playing on white clover lawns or going barefoot. Farm boys may
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
be severely stung as a result of molesting beehives or throwing stones
at bees&rsquo; nests in trees or caves.</p>
<p>Normally, poison introduced by the sting of a honeybee is local in
effect and little more than a painful inconvenience to the person stung.
There are many cases on record, however, of persons and domestic
animals receiving stings from so many of the enraged insects that serious
and even fatal results have followed.</p>
<p>During the past half century, medical records show a number of
deaths each resulting from a single sting. Jones<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> made an intensive study
of this problem and was able to show conclusively that occasional individuals
become supersensitive to honeybee venom. If persons in such
condition receive even the small amount of poison injected by a single
sting, the resulting excessive susceptibility may be fatal unless proper
treatment is administered immediately. To such persons the honeybee is
definitely a poisonous and dangerous creature.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Poison mechanism of worker bee, greatly enlarged.</i></p>
</div>
<dl class="pcap"><dt>1. Poison sack or reservoir.</dt>
<dt>2. Muscles which force sting into flesh and pump poison from sack. These muscles continue operating for as long as 20 minutes after the sting has been torn from the bee&rsquo;s body.</dt>
<dt>3. Sheath within which shafts of sting slide.</dt>
<dt>4. Barbed tip of sting. These barbs hold the sting in the flesh of the victim so securely as to tear the sting from the body of the bee.</dt></dl>
<h3 id="c27"><i>How a bee stings</i></h3>
<p>The poison-injecting mechanism of the worker bee is located within
the extremity of the abdomen and consists of a barbed sting at the base
of which is attached a sack, or reservoir, containing the poison. Male
bees (drones) have no sting, and the queen reserves hers for possible
use in battle with a rival queen.</p>
<p>In the act of stinging, the bee forces the tip of the sting through the
skin of the victim, where it becomes imbedded, being held by the barbs.
In escaping the bee tears away, leaving the sting, poison sack, and attached
muscles and viscera. Incidentally, this rupture results in the
death of the bee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Capillarity and the spasmodic movement of the attached muscles
force the poison from the sack through the hollow shaft of the sting
into the wound.</p>
<h3 id="c28"><i>Treatment of bee sting</i></h3>
<p><i>To counteract this, the first thing that anyone should do when stung
by a honeybee is to SCRAPE out the sting. This may be done with a
knife blade or even with the fingernail, although the latter is far from
sanitary. NEVER PULL OUT THE STING, because in grasping the
protruding poison sack between the thumb and forefinger, the sack is
certain to be pinched and the poison squeezed into the wound.</i></p>
<p><i>Since, under normal conditions, it takes several seconds for the contents
of the sack to work into the puncture, prompt removal of the sting
with the attached sack prevents much of the poison from being injected.</i></p>
<p><i>Application of strong household ammonia just as soon as the sting
is scraped out is helpful in allaying the pain.</i></p>
<p><i>If a person receives a great number of stings, a physician should be
summoned at once. The victim should be undressed, put in bed, and all
of the sting scraped out. All parts of the body that have received stings
should be covered with cloths soaked in hot water and wrung out.
These applications should be as hot as the victim can endure.</i></p>
<p>Persons who are supersensitive to bee-sting venom show the following
symptoms when stung: the skin over the entire body breaks out in
lumpy welts, palms of the hands and soles of the feet itch. This is followed
by headache, nausea, and vomiting. Breathing becomes labored
and heart action is rapid and weak.</p>
<p>As soon as such symptoms are noted, a physician should be summoned
or the victim taken to a hospital. Treatment consists of frequent,
small, hypodermic injections of epinephrine in the ratio of one part of
epinephrine to 1,000 parts of water. Dr. W. Ray Jones<a class="fn" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>, who developed
and perfected this treatment, reports that it is immediately effective
and recommends that all commercial beekeepers provide themselves with
hypodermic kits and a small supply of epinephrine.</p>
<p>Even persons who are apparently immune to bee-sting venom through
having received bee stings during the course of many years of work in
the apiary, may suddenly develop supersensitivity. The treatment is
relatively simple, may be self-administered, and has already proved effective
in treating serious cases of excessive susceptibility resulting from
supersensitive persons receiving bee stings.</p>

a high degree of success. Physicians should investigate &ldquo;Death

throughout the southern states feeding on the foliage of oak, elm, plum,
and sycamore trees. They have been found also in truck gardens and

<p>Because of their long, silky hairs, children are tempted to touch
them. Under the hairs are small protrusions, each bearing a circlet of
very small spines resembling tiny porcupine quills. The venom is injected
when these spines pierce the child&rsquo;s skin and the tips break off, producing
a burning, itching, irritated, inflamed area. The welts, ranging
in size from a dime to a dollar, are sometimes followed by severe muscle
cramps and headache. Not lethal, the toxin may cause enough sleeplessness
in a child to reduce his resistance to other infections.</p>
<p>Treatment suggested by Dr. Bernard J. Collopy, Assistant Medical
Director of the Miami-Inspiration Hospital of Miami, Arizona, consists
of immersing the inflamed area in iced water for thirty minutes. Remove
for one minute at ten minute intervals for relief from the cold.
The skin may blister and peel at the site much as in the case of a first
degree burn, but should heal completely in ten days. Some physicians
suggest an opiate for relief of pain in severe cases. Cooling lotions may
be applied to relieve the itching.</p>

<span class="attr ss smaller">(Photo by Marvin H. Frost, Sr.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The Arizona coral is shy and secretive in its habits, timid rather
than pugnacious, and it is so rarely seen that little is known of its
habits.</p>
<p>The poison mechanism of the coral snake is somewhat different from
that of the pit viper group, to which the copperheads, cottonmouths,
and rattlesnakes belong. The teeth of the coral are short, and to be effective
the coral snake must chew rather than strike its victim.</p>
<p>The Arizona coral snake is so small&mdash;rarely reaching 2 feet in length&mdash;and
its mouth is so tiny, that it would be very difficult for it to bite
an adult human. It is conceivable that a small child playing with one
might be bitten.</p>
<p>Because of its close resemblance to several ringed or banded snakes
of the desert and also to the Arizona mountain kingsnake, or &ldquo;coral&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
kingsnake, of the ponderosa pine highlands of the Southwest, a brief
description of the Arizona coral snake is indicated. One of the beautifully
spectacular snakes of the desert, it is marked by bands of dark
red, cream, and black, which encircle the body. Superficially the markings
of the Arizona mountain kingsnake and other tricolored ringed
snakes appear similar. However, the red of the kingsnake and of others
is usually brighter, and the black bands narrower than those of the
coral.</p>
<p>Definite identification is provided by the relationship of the colors
to each other, the arrangement on the Arizona coral snake being red,
cream, black, cream, red, cream, black, cream. The bands of the Arizona
coral snake entirely circle the body and its snout is black.</p>
<h2 id="c31">Rattlesnakes
<br /><span class="smaller">(Genus <i>Crotalus</i>, spp.)</span></h2>
<p>Thirty species and subspecies of rattlesnakes occur in the United
States, more than half of this number being found in the Southwest.
Because they have been killed on sight for years, their numbers have
been considerably reduced in densely populated areas. For this reason,
together with emphasis placed upon their poisonous characteristics by
some writers of western thriller fiction, rattlesnakes are considered by
many people to be a serious menace in the thinly populated portions of
the arid West<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>.</p>

<span class="attr ss smaller">(Photo by Earl Jackson)</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c32"><i>Where rattlesnakes are found</i></h3>
<p>In the hot desert regions of the Southwest rattlesnakes are usually
abroad at night during the summer months, as they have no controlling
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
system for body temperature and cannot endure the heat at ground
surface during the hours of sunlight. In spring and autumn they may
be encountered in the daytime but during December, January, and February
they are in hibernation and are rarely or never seen.</p>
<p>Their food consists principally of lizards and small rodents such as
ground squirrels, rats, mice, pocket gophers and young rabbits. They
are sometimes found along irrigation canal banks where they go for
water, and because they find rodents congregating there for the same
reason. Unless surprised, cornered, teased, handled, or injured, a rattlesnake
usually will try to remain hidden or will endeavor to crawl away
rather than strike. Because they are attracted to places where
small rodents abound, they are sometimes encountered around barns
and outbuildings. They occasionally enter abandoned structures in
search of food or to escape from the heat of the sun.</p>
<h3 id="c33"><i>Protective clothing</i></h3>
<p>Because a rattlesnake may be met at almost any time, except during
the winter months, by a person who lives, works, or visits in the desert,
he should be ever alert. If hiking or climbing through country
where rattlesnakes are known to be abundant, he should wear clothing
that will protect him from a possible bite.</p>
<p>Pope<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> states that records kept during 1928 and 1929 show that 98
per cent of snake bites occurred below the knee or on the hand or forearm.
When in snake country, the hiker should wear knee-high boots
or leggings, and should never place his hand on a rock or ledge above
the level of his eyes. In other words, watch your step, and look before
you reach! Apparently rattlesnakes may strike at a quick movement
and are very sensitive to the body warmth of a nearby warm-blooded
creature.</p>
<h3 id="c34"><i>Rattlesnake relatives</i></h3>
<p>Rattlesnakes belong to the group known as the pit vipers, which includes
the cottonmouths and the copperheads. The latter do not occur
in the desert, so they do not come within the province of this publication.
Snakes of the pit viper group are characterized by a noticeable
depression, or pit, found almost halfway between the eye and the nostril,
but slightly lower, on each side of the head.</p>
<p>Of the several species found in the desert, some, such as the western
diamondback rattlesnake have a wide range, while others are restricted
to limited areas. Some species attain large size, while others are
quite small; some are inclined to be pugnacious, while others are more
or less docile. All are dangerous!</p>
<p>It is not within the scope of this publication to enter into a discussion
of the many species, so the reader who wishes to pursue that subject
further is referred to Klauber&rsquo;s publication on the rattlesnakes<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c35"><i>The Sidewinder</i></h3>
<p>There is one rattlesnake of the desert that should be especially mentioned:
the sidewinder, or the little horned rattlesnake. It is called sidewinder
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
because of the peculiar method of locomotion that enables it to
progress in the sandy habitat which it frequents. Unable to get sufficient
traction in loose sand by moving as other snakes do, it throws a
portion of its body ahead as a loop, thus serving to anchor or pull the
rest of the body ahead. Thus it progresses sideways in a looping, or
winding, motion most interesting to observe.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="535" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Sidewinder or &ldquo;horned&rdquo; rattlesnake</i></p>
</div>
<p>Although the term sidewinder is often used loosely in referring to
other species of rattlesnakes, it actually applies only to this particular
species&mdash;<i>Crotalus cerastes</i>.</p>
<h3 id="c36"><i>Helpful precautions</i></h3>
<p>In snake country, it is important to take a flashlight along whenever
there is occasion to go outside at night in summer to be sure that there
are no rattlesnakes lying across your path. If you sleep out of doors.
keep your bed off the ground if possible. The widely believed statement
that, &ldquo;a rattlesnake will not crawl across a hair rope&rdquo; is not true,
although such a statement will often precipitate an argument.</p>
<p>Persons much in the field should provide themselves with a suction-type
snakebite kit, and should know how to use it. Although you stand
200 chances of being killed by an automobile to one of dying from
snakebite, the price of a suction-type kit is cheap insurance against that
possibility.</p>
<h3 id="c37"><i>First aid for rattlesnake bite</i></h3>
<p><i>If, in spite of all precautions, you or some companion should be bitten
by a rattlesnake, first-aid should be rendered at once. This is not</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
<i>difficult if you have a snakebite kit, and it is possible even if you do not.</i></p>
<p><i>The following steps are quite universally accepted:</i></p>
<p><i>1. Apply a tourniquet a short distance above the bite (that is between
it and the heart) but do not make it too tight. This prevents the
blood and lymph carrying the poison from being spread rapidly
through the body. The tourniquet should be loosened for a few seconds
every 20 minutes.</i></p>
<p><i>2. Make a short cut about one-fourth inch deep and one-fourth
inch long near each fang puncture with a sharp, sterile instrument. A
knife or razor blade sterilized in the flame of a match will do.</i></p>
<p><i>3. Apply suction to the cuts. If no suction cup is available, the
mouth will do if it contains no open sores.</i></p>
<p><i>4. If antivenin is available, administer it according to instructions,
but, if possible, this should be left to a physician. (Recent experiments
with antivenin indicate that, in some cases, its reaction may be harmful
and that it should be administered only under the care of a physician.)</i></p>
<p><i>5. Get the patient to medical help as soon as possible, continuing
the first-aid treatment enroute. Keep the patient quiet and do not let
him get frightened or excited. Rather than require the patient to walk
or otherwise exercise, medical aid should be brought to him.</i></p>
<p><i>6. If medical help is not available, and if Epsom salts can be obtained,
apply cloths soaked in a strong, hot solution of Epsom salts
over the cuts. The sucking, however, should be continued for at least
half an hour, preferably for an hour or more. Never give alcoholic stimulants
or use permanganate of potash. Snakebite kits give complete
instructions; follow them carefully.</i></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Rattlesnake venom contains digestive enzymes which attack and destroy
tissue, and because of this and the possibility of bacterial infection
introduced by cutting the skin, another method of treatment&mdash;cryotherapy
(treatment with cold)&mdash;advocated by Dr. Herbert L.
Stahnke, Poisonous Animals Laboratory, Arizona State University,
seems to be gaining more and more support. This technique is designed
to prevent and control the chemical action of the venom and of bacteria,
as well as minimizing stress. This latter action is extremely important,
since recent research work has indicated that the physiological
products produced by the body under stress may more than double the
toxic effects of the venom. Cut-and-suction, or any similar treatment,
tends to greatly increase stress.</p>
<p>The following description of treatment is excerpted from &ldquo;American
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,&rdquo; Volume 6, Number 2,
March, 1957, <i>The Treatment of Snake Bite</i>, by Herbert L. Stahnke,
Fredrick M. Allen, Robert V. Horan, and John H. Tenery:</p>
<p><i>1. Place a ligature (tight tourniquet) at once between the site of
the bite and the body, but as near the point of entrance of the venom
as possible.</i></p>
<p><i>2. Place a piece of ice on the site while preparing a suitable vessel
of crushed ice and water.</i></p>
<p><i>3. Place the bitten hand or other member in the iced water well above
the point of ligation.</i></p>
<p><i>4. After the envenomed member has been in the iced water for not
less than 5 minutes (N.B. research has shown that the danger generally
attributed to a ligature is not present when the member is refrigerated),
remove the ligature, but keep the member in the iced water
for at least 2 hours.</i></p>
<p><i>5. Pack the envenomed member in finely crushed ice. This hypothermia
must continue for approximately 24 hours, and the patient
must not be permitted to chill, since this increases body stress.</i></p>
<p><i>6. Change from hypothermia to cryotherapy. This is accomplished
as follows: after the first 24 hours following the bite, the patient should
be kept somewhat uncomfortably warm&mdash;that is, to the point of perspiration&mdash;and
encouraged to drink much water. This step is exceedingly
important. Unless the patient is kept uncomfortably warm the
proteolytic portion of the venom will not leave the site of the bite. Consequently,
when hypothermia is stopped, the concentration of this part
of the venom is greater and the tissue destruction will be proportionately
increased. Hypothermia should be avoided entirely if this step is
not meticulously observed.</i></p>

<p><i>7. The warm-up period after Cryotherapy is important. This must
be done gradually. Remove the member from the crushed ice and place
it in ice water (without ice). Allow the water to warm to room temperature.</i></p>
<p>Dr. Walter C. Alvarez in the <i>Santa Fe New Mexican</i>, 8-18-57: &ldquo;Recently,
Dr. Wm. Deichmann, John E. Dees, M. L. Keplinger, John J.
Farrell, and W. E. MacDonald Jr. reported that hydrocortizone is a
life-saving drug when given to animals that have suffered poisoning
from rattlesnake venom. Instead of only the 17% of the untreated animals
that survived, 75% of treated animals were saved.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c38">Back-fanged snakes</h2>
<p>The southwestern desert regions are credited with harboring several
genera of snakes whose grooved back teeth indicate that they may
have poisonous properties. Of these, the Sonora lyre snake<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> (<i>Trimorphodon
lambda</i>) and the Mexican vine snake (<i>Oxybelis aeneus auratus</i>)
are the only species of sufficient size to be considered as even remotely
dangerous to mankind. Species of the genera <i>Tantilla</i> (black-headed
snake), <i>Hypsiglena</i>, and <i>Sonora</i> are too small and too difficult
for the amateur to identify to be considered in this publication.</p>

<h2 id="c39">Gila monster
<br /><span class="smaller">(<i>Heloderma suspectum</i>)</span></h2>
<p>More conflicting statements are made about the Gila (HEE-lah)
monster than about any other desert reptile. Some persons insist that
it is not poisonous, others are sure that even its breath is poisonous:
that it spits or blows its poison: that the animal has no anal opening,
hence undigested fecal matter remains in the body, decays, and is the
basis of its poison; and so on.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p16a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="502" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Gila monster</i> (Heloderma suspectum).</p>
</div>
<p>Here are the facts. The lizard is poisonous and its bite may be serious,
possibly fatal<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>. Its breath is not poisonous, and although the animal
seems to have a chronic case of halitosis, this has nothing to do
with its dangerous properties. It does not spit poison, but when angered
it frequently hisses, the outcoming blast of air sometimes carrying
droplets of saliva. It has a normal anal opening and voids fecal matter
in a perfectly normal manner. It is not a walking septic tank as
many persons believe.</p>
<p>Largest of the lizards native to the United States, and the only species
found in this country which is poisonous, the Gila monster rarely
attains a length of 2 feet. Average specimens are smaller. Its beady
skin, heavy body, short legs, and waddling gait set it apart from all
other lizards except its close relative, the also poisonous <i>Heloderma
horridum</i> of Mexico. The Gila Monster is a spectacular black and corral
color, while the other is black and yellow.</p>
<p>Gila monsters are found in southern Arizona, their range extending
northwestward into the southern tip of Nevada and southwestern
Utah.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Underside of Gila monster showing anal opening. This photograph is advanced
as proof that the Gila monster is a perfectly normal creature in this respect.</i>
<span class="attr ss smaller">(Photo courtesy of Poisonous Animals Research Laboratory, Tempe, Arizona)</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c40"><i>Food and habits</i></h3>
<p>Food consists chiefly of bird and reptile eggs, young rodents, and
such small or juvenile creatures as it is able to capture. It is especially
fond of hen eggs and may be kept in captivity for a long time without
other food. It is also fond of clear water, which seems strange because
of the scarcity of this liquid in the natural habitat of the lizard. If provided
with a basin of water it may lie partly submerged for hours.</p>
<p>Occasionally encountered ambling across stretches of open desert,
especially in the spring, the Gila monster is normally docile and bends
every effort toward escape among the stiff stems of some bush or beneath
the protecting spine-clad stems of a cactus plant. Sometimes an
individual with a &ldquo;chip on its shoulder&rdquo; may be met, or one in a normal
state of mind may be teased or prodded into anger, when it advances
with open mouth, sputtering and hissing.</p>
<p>When aroused, the Gila monster is remarkably agile, making quick
turns of its head to snap at nearby objects. If it secures a grip, it hangs
on with bulldog-like tenacity, grinding the object between its teeth.</p>
<p>Gila monsters reproduce by means of eggs which are about 2&frac12; inches
long with a tough, parchment-like skin. From 5 to 13 eggs are deposited
by the female in a hole which she scoops in moist sand in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
sunny location. After laying the eggs, she covers them with sand, and
leaves them for the heat of the sun to hatch.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">

<p>The Gila monster&rsquo;s tail serves as a storehouse of nourishment, being
thick and heavy in times of plenty, and thin and rope-like in the early
spring when the reptile first appears after months of hibernation, during
which time it has lived on the reservoir of fat stored in its tail.</p>
<h3 id="c41"><i>Poison of the Gila monster</i></h3>
<p>The poison of the Gila monster is produced by glands in the lower
jaw. To be most effective, the poison must be ground into the wound
through action of the grooved teeth, the process taking a little time.
Bitten persons who immediately have broken away sometimes show no
effects of the venom, therein lying the basis for the widespread statement
that Gila monsters are not poisonous.</p>
<p>Bitten persons who have been unable to release themselves show
symptoms of poisoning similar to persons suffering from rattlesnake
bite, although the poison is more neurotoxic in action. Breathing and
heart action are speeded up, followed by a gradual paralysis of the
heart and breathing muscles.</p>
<p><i>Treatment is essentially the same as that for rattlesnake bite, which
is described earlier in this booklet. A physician should be summoned at
once. Stimulants are dangerous, and no one should be permitted to give
the patient any alcohol whatever.</i></p>
<p>Prevention is much simpler than cure, so Gila monsters should be
allowed to mind their own affairs unmolested. Normally they are not
pugnacious, and it would be very difficult for one to bite a human unless
it were being teased or handled or were stepped upon by a bare-footed
child. Please do not kill or capture Gila monsters. These interesting
lizards are a unique feature of native desert wildlife threatened
with extinction. Please leave them for other people to see and enjoy.
Furthermore, the Gila monster is protected by State law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c42">Harmless Creatures Mistakenly Believed Poisonous</h2>
<p>Practically everyone is aware of the widespread fear of snakes exhibited
by people of all races and in all walks of life. This fear although
largely emotional, is rationalized by many persons with the statement
&ldquo;Well, it MIGHT be poisonous.&rdquo; Other persons believe that there is
some rule of thumb, such as a flat or triangular-shaped head, by which
all poisonous snakes may be recognized. A great many persons kill all
snakes, just on general principles. Thus the innocent suffer with the
guilty, the harmless with the dangerous.</p>
<p>As scientists explore deeper and deeper into the intricacies of animal
behavior and obtain more and more knowledge of the ecological relationships
among animals and between animals and plants, it becomes
increasingly clear that these relationships present a delicate balance or
adjustment of nature. Epidemic diseases, disasters such as fires and
floods, and radical climatic changes may upset or alter these relationships,
sometimes with far-reaching effects.</p>
<p>But the greatest and most persistent disturber of the biological peace
is MAN. Almost every time man reduces or destroys one phase of nature,
he releases, in so doing, previously unrecognized forces which
turn on him in a manner that he least expects. Snakes, in general, live
on small rodents, thereby helping to maintain a balance whereby rodents
are unable to increase to such a point that they get out of nature&rsquo;s
control. Kill all of the snakes in a given area, and some of the control
on rodent population is removed with a resulting increase in the destruction
of vegetation and consequent damage to farmers&rsquo; crops. So if
you must kill snakes, by all means limit your activities to those which
are known definitely to be poisonous.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of this booklet is to familiarize the desert dweller
or visitor with the snakes that ARE poisonous. All the rest are harmless,
in fact they are generally beneficial to mankind, even though their
heads may be triangular in shape. A given territory is capable of supporting
a rather definite number of snakes. Kill the harmless ones and
those that come in to take their place may be poisonous species.</p>
<p>In all parts of the country certain creatures, particularly reptiles, are
credited with supernatural powers for causing injury or aid to human
beings. Among aboriginal peoples, these superstitions are a part of their
religion and have a powerful effect upon their thinking. For example,
among the Hopi Indians of northern Arizona, snakes may be messengers
who, if properly indoctrinated, will convey to the rain gods expressions
of the people&rsquo;s need for moisture in order that their crops
may mature.</p>
<p>Even among a people who for years have had the benefit of scientific
knowledge, superstitions persist. The hoopsnake and the milksnake
offer cases in point, and there will be readers of this booklet who will
toss it aside in anger because it states that both of these myths are
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
without substantiation in fact.</p>

<p>These imaginary tales are passed from generation to generation and
are the strongest in regions where the percentage of uneducated
people is high. This situation exists in the South and Southwest. Many
persons who have been denied educational opportunities are extremely
credulous and have a long list of creatures to each of which they credit
injurious or helpful powers. A majority of these creatures are perfectly
harmless, but they are too numerous to be given space in this publication.
However, it seems only fair to mention a few of the commonest
of these persecuted species in the hope that they may be recognized
as not only harmless, but in many cases actually beneficial to man.
Thus may their unwarranted persecution be somewhat reduced.</p>
<h2 id="c43">Banded gecko
<br /><span class="smaller">(<i>Coleonyx variegatus</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Quite small, with velvety skin and delicate markings making it appear
fragile and semitransparent, this lizard has little to inspire fear.
Hiding away during daylight hours in dark and preferably moist retreats,
it comes forth at night in search of insects for food.</p>
<p>It is rarely seen unless disturbed in its hiding place, which may be in
the corner of a closet or cupboard beneath the sink. If captured, it
struggles to escape, emitting a faint, high-pitched squeak.</p>
<p>Although the banded gecko is sometimes mistaken for the young of
a Gila monster, in general the desert people accuse it of no definite
crime, stating merely &ldquo;we have heard that it is very poisonous,&rdquo; and
in consequence, kill it whenever they find it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything so ugly MUST be poisonous,&rdquo; seems to be the principal

<p>It is often found inside buildings where it has gone in search of insect
prey, and Mexican families living in adobe houses with dirt floors
are reported to be terrorized by it. In Mexico and in many parts of the
Southwest it is known as <i>ni&ntilde;a de la tierra</i> or child-of-the-earth.</p>
<p>The range of the solpugid or sun spider is by no means limited to
the desert, but its reputation as a poisonous creature seems to be much
worse in the Southwest than elsewhere.</p>

</div>
<p>Although quite common, the Jerusalem cricket, <i>Stenopelmatus</i> sp., is
shy and nocturnal in its habits. Its striking appearance is due to its
head which is round, bald, and with markings on top that form, with
the use of a little imagination, a simple, smiling face. It is this that suggests
to the Spanish-speaking people of the Southwest, who occasionally
dig it from its burrow, the name &ldquo;<i>ni&ntilde;a de la tierra</i>.&rdquo; The Navajo Indians
call it <i>woh-seh-tsinni</i>, meaning Old Man Bald-head.</p>
<p>By the superstitious natives, this creature is believed to be highly
venomous and frequently the death of a horse or cow is blamed by
the owner on a &ldquo;<i>chacho</i>&rdquo; that has crawled into the hay.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Vinegaroon</i>
<span class="attr ss smaller">(Photo by Marvin H. Frost, Sr.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The name vinegaroon stems from the fact that when the little creature
is injured or smashed it gives off the odor of an acetate similar to
that of acetic acid, the principal ingredient of vinegar.</p>
<p>Equipped with a massive pair of pincers, the vinegaroon, like the
solpugid, gives an impression of fierceness which is probably the basis
for much of its reputation as a dangerous criminal. However, the pincers
are used in catching and holding prey and have no poison mechanism
in connection.</p>
<p>The hairlike posterior appendage, or tail, is without any protective
or offensive mechanism whatever, so that the creature is perfectly
harmless insofar as human beings are concerned.</p>
<p>In fact, like the solpugid and the banded gecko, its food habits cause
it to rid the world of a great many insects during the course of its life
and many of its victims are certain to be noxious to the interests of
mankind.</p>
<p>All of these creatures, then, are not only harmless, but are actually
beneficial to man, and they deserve to be freed from the persecution
resulting from ignorance and superstition, and to be permitted to live in
their normal relationship with other creatures.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
